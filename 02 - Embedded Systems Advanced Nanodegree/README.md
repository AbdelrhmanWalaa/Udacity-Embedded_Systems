## Overview

Enhance your skills in the Embedded Systems field and be more professional in your career by getting hands-on practice in embedded systems advanced topics. You will have hands-on system design, both static and dynamic designs, which helps you make very efficient and clear systems designs.

## Technical Training

1. **Static Design**

    - You will be able to make an efficient static design for larger projects.
    - You will be able to make pre-build, linking, and post-build configurations.
    - You will be familiar with practical stacks (OSI layer and AUTOSAR).

2. **Dynamic Design**

    - You will be able to make an efficient dynamic design for larger projects.
    - You will be able use UML toolbox in your design.
    - You will be familiar to different design patterns.
    - You will be able to implement basic communication module and small OS.

3. **ARM Programming**

    - You will be able to program GPIO, ADC, WDT in ARM microcontrollers.
    - You will learn how bootloaders are work and you will be able to implement your own bootloader.\

4. **Real-Time Operating Systems**

    - You will be able to differentiate between RTOS and general purpose systems.
    - You will be able to build your projects using FreeRTOS.
    - You will be able to analyse FreeRTOS and calculate tasks deadlines.
    - You will be able to handle tasks synchronization and communications.
    - You will be able to implement different schedulers.

5. **Introduction to SW Testing**

    - Youâ€™ll learn the basic foundation of SW testing.
    - Understand different testing techniques and how SW testers catch issues and enhance the overall quality of SW products.
      You will be familiar with the test process.
