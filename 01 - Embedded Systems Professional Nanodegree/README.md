## Overview

Enter the Embedded Systems field by getting hands-on practice in embedded systems. A recap on C programming with a big project will enhance the C programming skills that you will need in embedded systems. 

You will learn how to program microcontroller peripherals, interface your microcontroller to the world through input and output devices using Atmega32 microcontroller programming, and make excellent system static design. Learn how to set up communication between different microcontrollers. Implement exciting projects that will put your knowledge and potential to the max.
