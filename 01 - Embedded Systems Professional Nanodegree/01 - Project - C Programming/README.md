## Overview

Welcome to the Virtual Banking System project! In this project, we have created a simulated environment that emulates a payment system for conducting SALE transactions. The system includes the interaction between a virtual card, terminal (ATM), and server to facilitate seamless SALE transactions. 

Payment systems have become an integral part of our daily lives, and this project aims to provide a hands-on experience with the functionalities and processes involved in a virtual banking system. The focus of this project is on the SALE transaction, which allows users to make purchases and have the corresponding amount deducted from their bank accounts.

## Features

- **Simulated SALE Transaction:** The Virtual Banking System enables users to simulate a SALE transaction, emulating the process of buying something and deducting the purchase amount from the user's bank account.

- **Multiple Transaction Types:** Although the primary focus is on the SALE transaction, the system is designed to handle other transaction types, including REFUND, Pre-Authorization, and VOID. These additional transaction types contribute to the comprehensive understanding of payment systems.

- **Virtual Card, Terminal, and Server:** The project encompasses a virtual card, a terminal (ATM), and a server, each playing a crucial role in the transaction process. The interactions between these components are emulated to provide a realistic payment system experience.

- **Secure Transactions:** Security is a priority in any banking system. The Virtual Banking System ensures that the simulated transactions are conducted securely and that sensitive information is handled with utmost care.

- **Hands-on Learning:** By actively participating in the implementation of the SALE transaction, users can gain practical insights into the intricacies of a payment system, including the communication flow between various components.
