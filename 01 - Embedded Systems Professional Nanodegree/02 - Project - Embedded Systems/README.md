## Overview

The On-demand Traffic Light Control project aims to implement a smart traffic lights system with an on-demand crosswalk button. Traffic lights are vital signaling devices used at road intersections, pedestrian crossings, and various other locations to efficiently regulate the flow of traffic and ensure road safety.

Traditionally, traffic lights consist of three signals, usually arranged vertically or horizontally in the order of red, yellow, and green. These colors convey specific meanings to drivers and riders, guiding them through the intersection safely.

However, this project goes beyond the conventional traffic light setup by introducing an on-demand crosswalk button. The addition of crosswalk buttons allows pedestrians to signal their intention to cross the street, prompting the traffic light system to adjust its timing. This adjustment ensures that pedestrians are granted sufficient time to safely cross the road without disrupting the overall traffic flow.

## Features

- **Standard Traffic Light Operation:** The traffic light system will operate according to the international standard, with the sequence of red, yellow, and green signals to manage vehicular traffic at intersections.

- **On-demand Crosswalk Button:** A dedicated crosswalk button will be provided for pedestrians. When pressed, it will trigger the traffic light system to accommodate pedestrians and provide them with a safe crossing duration.

- **Dynamic Timing Adjustment:** Upon activation of the crosswalk button, the traffic light timings will be dynamically adjusted to allow pedestrians to cross safely, minimizing traffic disruptions while ensuring pedestrian safety.

- **Smart Traffic Management:** The project will employ smart algorithms to optimize traffic light timings based on real-time traffic conditions, aiming to enhance traffic flow efficiency and reduce congestion.

- **User-friendly Interface:** The system will feature an intuitive and user-friendly interface for both pedestrians and drivers, making it easy for all users to understand and interact with the traffic light system.

- **Configurable Local Variations:** The project will be flexible enough to accommodate local and national variations in traffic light sequences and regulations, ensuring compliance with specific regional requirements.

- **Real-time Feedback:** The traffic light system may provide real-time feedback to users, such as displaying countdown timers for pedestrians or drivers, enhancing safety and convenience.
